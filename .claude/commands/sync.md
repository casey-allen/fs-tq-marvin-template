# /sync - Get Updates

Pull new features and commands from the MARVIN template into your workspace.

## Instructions

### 1. Find the Template

Read `.marvin-source` to get the path to the template directory:
```bash
cat .marvin-source
```

If this file doesn't exist, tell the user:
> "I can't find your template source. This usually means you set up MARVIN manually. Would you like to tell me where your template folder is?"

### 2. Check What's New

Compare the template's files with the user's workspace:

**Files to sync:**
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands
- `.claude/agents/` - Subagent definitions
- `.claude/skills/` - Reusable skills

**Files to NEVER sync (user's data):**
- `config.yaml` - User's personalized settings
- `sessions/` - Session logs
- `reports/` - Weekly reports
- `skills/` - User's generated skills
- `CLAUDE.md` - User's profile
- `.env` - User's secrets

### 3. Identify Changes

For each file in the template's `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, and `.claude/skills/`:
- If it doesn't exist in the workspace: NEW
- If it exists but differs: CONFLICT (user's version wins)
- If it's identical: UNCHANGED

### 4. Show What's Available

Display something like:

```
## Updates Available

**New commands:**
- /newcommand - Description

**New skills:**
- new-skill/ - Description

**Conflicts (your version kept):**
- /existingcommand - Template has updates, but keeping yours

No changes to your data (goals, sessions, etc.) - those are always safe.
```

### 5. Apply Updates

Ask: "Would you like me to add the new commands/agents/skills?"

If yes, copy the NEW files only. Never overwrite existing files.

```bash
# Example for a new command
cp {template}/.claude/commands/newcommand.md .claude/commands/
```

### 6. Handle Conflicts

If there are conflicts, explain:
> "I found some commands that exist in both places. I kept your versions since you may have customized them. If you want the template version instead, let me know which ones and I'll update them."

### 7. Check Blueprint Updates

Compare `skill-blueprints/` in the template with the user's workspace `skills/`:

For each blueprint directory (e.g., `skill-blueprints/team-digest/`):
- Check if the user has a corresponding skill (e.g., `skills/team-digest/`)
- If they do, compare the blueprint SKILL.md with the user's SKILL.md
- If the blueprint is newer or different:
  - Show what changed (brief summary)
  - Offer to regenerate: "The team-digest blueprint has been updated. Want me to regenerate your skill with the latest logic? Your config.yaml settings will be preserved."
  - If yes: Read `config.yaml`, regenerate the skill from the blueprint with config values substituted, show the diff, and write
  - If no: Note that their version is now custom

### 8. Check for New Guides

Read `config.yaml` for `guides_completed` list. Check `{template}/guides/` for guide files.

If there are guides not in `guides_completed`:
> "New guides available:
> - {guide name} — {description}
>
> Run `/guide {slug}` to walk through any of them."

### 9. Finish

After syncing:
> "All done! You now have the latest MARVIN features. Type `/help` to see what's available."
